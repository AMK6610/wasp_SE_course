## 1. Introduction/abstract to your research and topic area
My research covers the topic of collaborative cyber physical systems from a system of system perspective. More in detail, I am looking at the transportation realm and at the domain of connected automated vehicles (CAVs). The research aims at study and advance the state of the art of a number of dimensions characterising this domain, i.e., safety and security, societal benefit, performance and cost. Typical topics covered by this study are system design, safety analysis, requirement analysis, architecture design, fault analysis, wireless communication technology, communication protocols, logical and technical architectures, transportation, elements of cybersecurity, cooperative multi-agent systems, and automation and control. I am part of the KTH research centre TECoSA Trustworthy Edge Computing Systems and Application. In this view, I am studying applications of 5G to transportation, particularly from a communication safety critical perspective and looking into quality properties, such as connectivity robustness, availability, and latency. Furthermore, I am studying how CAV applications can benefit from Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), leveraging on 5G (release 16, and beyond) technology. MEC belongs to the edge cloud computing realm end consists of a computing facility and 5G functionalities being decentralized in a specific geographical region in order to provide a better Quality of Service (QoS). I will investigate some of the open questions pertaining to Edge and Fog cyber physical systems (cps), e.g., CAVs, such as detecting and mitigating failure and consequent graceful degradation of operation, how to hand-over workloads, trustworthy communication, trust domains, and how to detect available resources and services. Other relevant aspects are understanding the requirements for robust communication, latency, privacy, and security of the data in transit when workloads involve safety-critical applications such as cooperative maneuvers or sensor sharing and fusion. CAVs belong to a system of system sociotechnical context, i.e., mobility, characterized by a mixture of technologies and agent endowed with certain capabilities and classified at different levels. Example of capabilities are communication, automation, and cooperation. These agents can undergo independent evolution, thus exacerbating the differences amongst the cps present at the same time in the environment. The assets and cps ownership belonging to this context is fragmented and thus constituting a many hands problem where stakeholders need to dialog to advance the state of affair as no stakeholder alone possess enough power, interest or leverage to thrust innovation.

The chart (Kästner, “Model Quality: Defining Correctness and Fit”, 202) depicting the relationships of validation and verification made me deeply realise the validation double role. At first validation is used do determine specifics which must fulfil stakeholders needs. At last validation is used to ensure that the implementation of such specifics actually fulfils the stakeholders ‘needs. This is due to the nature of the underlying forces and relationship acting in the context. Requirements should capture the complexity of the problem, phenomena or system under investigation but they often fail in doing so. One of the principal causes is the human misunderstanding of the real mechanics or properties that the requirements are trying to describe. Another cause is the inherent complexity of the system we are trying to describe due to its properties and the relationships´ dynamics it has with the environment. Quality assurance and testing help in the validation and verification that the quality goals are reached by measuring the quality of the software artifacts via a quality metric based on quality criterions. Q&A encompasses a handful of dimensions, inter alia, economics and marketing (value loss due to malfunctions), safety and reliability, and certifications. These dimensions are well reflected in the CAVs domain as it is set in a sociotechnical context. There, safety, security, economics, wellbeing, ethic and trustworthiness are all quality goals of the system of system, Fornaro and Törngren (2023). The realization of such system of cps, heavily relies on software components that must ensure the intended functionality (or behaviour). In Software engineering, there are two groups of validation and verification techniques divided in static and dynamic. The static ones are commonly carried out via inspections, walkthrough and code reviews. The dynamic ones are tests conducted on a runnable software artifact. These tests have the aim of “…exercising a software system using a variety of inputs with the intention of validating its behaviour and discovering faults”, “.. by observing its execution behaviour”. Factors that influence the difficulty of software testing are, the high cardinality of the input and output space, the test dependency of context and domain (where and how the software artifact is run), the complexity of the system behaviour and loose or lacking requirements. Moreover, other factors such as specification misinterpretation or incapacity of formulating a test case and lack of testing culture exacerbate the difficulties of software testing. The poor definition of requirements can make them non-testable and wrong requirements can lead to undesired behaviours. Diverse test methods target different test levels, i.e., unit, integration, system, acceptance. In my work I will be studying system of systems (or collaborative systems) and looking at the integration and system level especially. In this context requirements stem from a variety of stakeholders and regulators and policy makers have the role of guarantee public safety.

## Select at least 2 principles/ideas/concepts/techniques from one of the three guest lectures and discuss how they relate to your research and topic area.
A ML software artifact generally learns a model that goes beyond the set of rules we intended it to learn. This set thus includes valid cases correctly modelled (the ones we want), valid cases wrongly modelled and invalid cases modelled. In the context of automated driving, DNN are commonly employed for perception tasks such as object recognition and tracking. Perception tasks are vital for higher level of driving automation and their accuracy and reliability a key point for the passenger safety. DNN are conceptually black box and understanding the input boundary is essential to understand the perception fault tolerance and reliability. In safety critical contexts, black box systems are often disregarded in favour of white box approaches. This is because there is a need to address the responsibility problem (who is to be blamed) when things go wrong. Nonetheless, DNN are largely used in AD perception and navigation tasks. Beyond the nominal DNN black box capability of accomplish perception tasks, the black box nature opens doors to adversarial attacks, bringing potential safety harm, due to its large input set. Efforts in safety and security are especially carried out in the attempt to find boundaries for worst case conditions. There are different severity levels for unwanted conditions (not all mistakes are equally serious) and being able to identify which combination of inputs produces a bad outcome is key to define boundaries. In the case of AD perception relaying on DNN we want to know the invariant input characteristics and possibly understand how much we need to modify the input to shift the output to another class. Oftentimes we see papers presenting ablation tests on their model in an attempt to explain how the black box model works. I think that more research around black box testing automation is needed to understand the reliability of ML models in safety critical context. This on the human side will also contribute to the acceptance of the advent of “self-driving cars”.

## Choose two topics. For each of them discuss your understanding of them and then describe areas of opportunity (new research challenges, commercial opportunities, application of Software Engineering ideas, methods and tools in AI/ML) with regard to these topics and your area of interest/research (in your PhD project). For each topic, search for and find at least one recent (published in the last 4 years) paper to inform your writing and thinking about the topic and its connection to your own research. As much as possible, relate the topics to your own experience and research / problem.
### Quality Assurance
Quality assurance in software engineering is a multifaceted approach involving standards, testing, and ongoing evaluation to deliver reliable and high-quality software products. It encompasses a set of systematic activities and processes designed to monitor, evaluate, and improve the software development lifecycle. Recent research by Garousi and Felderer (2020) highlights the significance of well-defined processes and standards in achieving software quality. Adherence to these standards helps identify defects and inconsistencies early in the development cycle, reducing the cost and effort required for later-stage corrections. Recent work by Jorgensen and Shepperd (2020) underscores the importance of testing in assuring software quality to verify that the software meets its specified requirements and functions correctly. Furthermore, quality assurance extends beyond the development phase, encompassing continuous monitoring and improvement as emphasised by researchers like Gorschek et al. (2018). Regular audits, reviews, and feedback loops are essential components of this process. Quality assurance in software engineering plays a pivotal role in the development of software systems for automated driving cars. These systems are characterised by their complexity and criticality, as they directly impact passenger safety. In this realm rigorous standards and best practices are established, both from private companies and standardisation bodies. For instance, ISO 26262 is an international standard for functional safety in the automotive industry, emphasising the need for well-defined processes and safety standards (Garousi & Felderer, 2020). Automated driving car software relies heavily on extensive testing and validation processes. This includes not only functional testing but also specialised testing for sensor fusion, perception, and decision-making algorithms. Ensuring that these components function correctly and reliably is paramount for passenger safety (Jorgensen & Shepperd, 2020). Just as software quality assurance extends beyond development in general, it also applies to automated driving car systems. Continuous monitoring through real-world testing and data collection is crucial for identifying potential issues. Feedback loops and over-the-air updates allow for continuous improvement and adaptation of the software to changing conditions and safety requirements (Gorschek et al., 2018). In the CAVs context this is enabled by connectivity and communication. In the automotive community increasing attention is given to SafeOps. Future areas of research related to my filed involve SE quality assurance for collaborative systems.

### Architecture and Design
Software architecture refers to the high-level structure of a software system, encompassing its components, their interactions, and the principles guiding their design. It is strictly bound to stakeholders´ views and should fulfil their needs. In the connected Intelligent Transportation System (C-ITS), this extends to not only the vehicle's onboard software but also the interconnected ecosystem, including communication protocols, edge services, and infrastructure. Recent research by Bass, Clements, and Kazman (2020) underscores the significance of architectural decisions in achieving system quality attributes, such as safety, security, and performance. CAVs are one of the agents acting in C-ITS which is regarder as a system of systems, where multiple independent systems (e.g., vehicle control, sensor networks, traffic management) collaborate to achieve a common goal. This necessitates a holistic architectural approach that considers not only the individual components but also their interactions and interfaces across systems. Architecture and design decisions must align with the overall system's goals and ensure seamless integration between subsystems. Software design delves into the detailed specifications of individual components within the architecture. For CAVs, this involves designing algorithms for perception, decision-making, and control, as well as user interfaces for human interaction. Effective design is crucial to meet the stringent requirements of real-time responsiveness and fault tolerance. Wu et al. (2020) emphasise the role of design patterns and modularity in enhancing the maintainability and reliability of such systems. Complex safety critical system of system such as C-ITS need dedicated SE design patterns and new architectures to harness the various aspects they come with.

## 5. Discuss your thoughts regarding the future trends and directions of Software Engineering in relation to your topic, your career (either in academia or in industry), and AI/ML in general. You should at least discuss ML/AI Engineering and how you think it and its importance will change in the coming 5-10 years.
In the coming 5-10 years, ML engineering will become even more critical in CAVs. As these vehicles become a common mode of transportation, the reliability, safety, and efficiency of AI/ML systems will be paramount. ML engineering will evolve to focus not only on model development but also on robust deployment, monitoring, and adaptation. Engineers will need to ensure that AI/ML systems work seamlessly in dynamic real-world scenarios, and as CAV fleets grow, they will face increased complexity in managing diverse datasets and models. Consequently, ML engineering will become integral to the ongoing success and safety of connected automated vehicles. AI and ML will play an even more pivotal role in CAVs, driving advancements in perception, decision-making, and autonomous navigation. Future software engineering will focus on seamlessly integrating these technologies to enhance safety and efficiency. CAVs will generate vast amounts of data, effective data management and processing will be crucial. Software engineers will need to develop robust data pipelines, storage solutions, and data labelling techniques to support ML algorithms. As CAVs reach higher levels of autonomy, ensuring the safety of AI/ML systems becomes paramount. Software engineers will need to focus on designing fault-tolerant systems, establishing safety standards, and conducting rigorous testing. There will be a greater emphasis on explainable AI in CAVs, ensuring that the decisions made by ML models are transparent and interpretable. This is critical for regulatory compliance and user trust. ML software will be distributed in edge nodes and privacy and information security must be ensured. ML software engineering practices must ensure no data spill over occurs. Regulatory bodies will probably introduce more stringent requirements for CAV software. Software engineers will need to work closely with policymakers to ensure compliance with safety and ethical standards. Furthermore, ML models in CAVs will need to continuously adapt to changing environments and conditions. Software engineering will involve designing systems that can retrain and update models seamlessly.
